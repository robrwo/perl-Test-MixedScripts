# NAME

Test::MixedScripts - test text for mixed and potentially confusable Unicode scripts

# VERSION

version v0.2.0

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Test::MixedScripts qw( all_perl_files_scripts_ok file_scripts_ok );

all_perl_files_scripts_ok();

file_scripts_ok( 'assets/site.js' );
```

# DESCRIPTION

This is a module to test that Perl code and other text files do not have potentially malicious or confusing Unicode
combinations.

# EXPORTS

## file\_scripts\_ok

```
file_scripts_ok( $filepath, @scripts );
```

This tests that the text file at `$filepath` contains only characters in the specified `@scripts`.
If no scripts are given, it defaults to `Common` and `Latin` characters.

You can override the defaults by adding a list of Unicode scripts, for example

```
file_scripts_ok( $filepath, qw/ Common Latin Cyryllic / );
```

You can also pass options as a hash reference,

```perl
file_scripts_ok( $filepath, { scripts => [qw/ Common Latin Cyryllic /] } );
```

A safer alternative to overriding the default scripts for a file is to specify an exception on each line using a special
comment:

```
"English b≈≠lgarski" ## Test::MixedScripts Latin,Cyrillic,Common
```

## all\_perl\_files\_scripts\_ok

```
all_perl_files_scripts_ok();

all_perl_files_scripts_ok( \%options, @dirs );
```

This applies ["file\_scripts\_ok"](#file_scripts_ok) to all of the Perl scripts in `@dirs`, or the current directory if they are omitted.
